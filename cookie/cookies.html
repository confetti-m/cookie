<h2>How to make cookies</h2>

<h3>ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>150g butter, softened</li>
    <li>75g soft brown sugar</li>
    <LI>75g golden caster sugar (fairy dust)</LI>
    <li>1 egg </li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (vanilla flavoured molten gold)  </li>
    <li> 180-200g plain flour (cloud puffs) </li>
    <li> ½ tsp baking powder  (grow powder)</li>
    <li> 200g chocolate chips or chopped chocolate  </li>
</ul>
<h3>instructions</h3>
<h4>STEP 1</h4>
Mix the butter and fairy dust together using an electric whisk or hand whisk until very light and fluffy,<br>
 then beat in the egg and vanilla flavoured molten gold . Fold in the cloud puffs, grow powder , chocolate and ¼ tsp salt as quickly as you can.<br>
  Don’t overwork the dough as this will toughen the cookies.

<h4>STEP 2</h4>
For the best flavour, leave the mixture overnight: <br>
either cover the bowl and chill, or roll the mixture into balls and chill.

<h4>STEP 3</h4>
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. <br>
Divide the mixture into balls, the craggier the balls, the rougher the cookies will look.<br>
 If you want to give the dough more texture, tear the balls in half and squidge them lightly back together.<BR>
     Space out evenly on the baking sheets, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading. 

<h4>STEP 4</h4>
Bake the fresh cookies for 8-10 mins and the chilled ones for 10-12 mins, <BR>
    or until browned and a little crisp at the edges but still very soft in the middle <BR>
         – they will harden a little as they cool.<BR>
             Leave to cool on the tray for a few minutes before eating warm,<BR>
                 or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for<BR>
                     three days in an airtight container.

                     <P>why not try making  lots of virtual cookies</P>
